./Images
- For real, create a directory with name mscoco inside this directory. For each of train, val and test, create directories with names train2014, val2014 and test2015 respectively inside mscoco directory, download respective images from [MS COCO website](http://mscoco.org/dataset/#download) and place them in respective folders.
- For abstract, create a directory with name abstract_v002 inside this directory. For each of train, val and test, create directories with names train2015, val2015 and test2015 respectively inside abstract_v002 directory, download respective images from [VQA download page](http://www.visualqa.org/download.html) and place them in respective folders.

./PythonHelperTools
- This directory contains the Python API to read and visualize the VQA dataset
- vqaDemo.py (demo script)
- vqaTools (API to read and visualize data)

./PythonEvaluationTools
- This directory contains the Python evaluation code
- vqaEvalDemo.py (evaluation demo script)
- vqaEvaluation (evaluation code)

./Results
- OpenEnded_mscoco_train2014_fake_results.json (an example of a fake results file for v1.0 to run the demo)
- Visit [VQA evaluation page] (http://visualqa.org/evaluation) for more details.

./QuestionTypes
- This directory contains the following lists of question types for both real and abstract questions (question types are unchanged from v1.0 to v2.0). In a list, if there are question types of length n+k and length n with the same first n words, then the question type of length n does not include questions that belong to the question type of length n+k.
